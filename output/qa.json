  "description" : "The Mental Health FHIR Implementation Guide defines core profiles, workflows, and terminology needed to support interoperable digital mental health services in Nepal. It aligns with the Tracker, and national health priorities to strengthen early detection, clinical management, referral, and monitoring of mental health conditions.\nThe requirements for this guide are informed by global FHIR best practices, Digital Public Goods (DPGs) principles, and interoperability frameworks such as WHO SMART Guidelines and OpenHIE architecture. The profiles and terminology defined here will serve as a foundation for future FHIR-based digital health initiatives in Nepal.\nOriginally developed as part of the FHIR standardization efforts, this guide evolves with stakeholder input and aligns with national health information exchange (HIE) policies. Future versions will expand to support additional use cases, analytics, and real-time data sharing capabilities for Nepalâ€™s health sector.",
